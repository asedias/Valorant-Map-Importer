# VALORANT Content Creation Tools & Scripts

IMPORTANT: This repo is not maintaned, I'm working on a better script, which will be released in December.

Some useful scripts & tools to be used with creating VALORANT content

## Extracting maps

Extracted Maps : https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1cWjlUmXz1-HsTYfoT4VaSSvepcDacAOi

### Extract them yourself :

Blender 2.93 or higher is needed.

    0 - Download this repo, and extract to somewhere that has lots of space.
    1 - Open "settings.ini" file using a text editor
    2 - Set the "PATH" to where .pak files are located
    4 - Open Blender, go to "Scripting" Panel
    5 - Drag & Drop the "importMap_cycles.py" file in to script panel
    6 - Click "Window > Toggle System Console" so you can see the process
    7 - Set "MAP" to the map you want in the script
    8 - Hit Run!

- When you first run the script it'll export almost everything related to the game and maps, so make sure you have enough space!
- If you do another import after running the script, it won't export them again. Just don't delete your "export" folder.
